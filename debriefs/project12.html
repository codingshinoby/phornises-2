                    Pretty well documentation. Has all necessary examples to complete.

                    It's undoable for people without a tech background.
                    Documentation can only be used with a server that you can access by ssh or can deploy it with a startup command(to run the web server).
                    It couldn't be completed with using a free Render service version
                    because it can run only static websites.
                    It could be completed with netlify, but to do this, you need to figure out a Netlify project structure and create a proper Netlify config, which also could be a challenge.

                    The environment setup is hidden too deep and can be easily missed by those who already have prerequisites(as it was in our case).

                    It should probably be moved to the *Set up a deposit form* section because it is also a part of the setup step as a server run step.
