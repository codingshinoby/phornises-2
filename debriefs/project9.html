            What made you smile?
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Searching for product images and setting up the application.
                    Seeing the final layout come together with product grids
                    and the ability to fast payment integration was satisfying.

            What did you find confusing? Did you encounter any issues?
            <ul>
                <li>No issues were encountered. Basically, it was a pretty similar flow to use Rebilly Instruments as in one of the first tasks.</li>
